<h2 class="title">And Beyond: Take on an Issue!</h2>

<p>
  After you've familiarized yourself with the development tools, and brushed up on web development, you are free to work on whatever you'd like!
  We personally recommend that you take on an issue on our repositories tagged with "good first issue" before really digging your heels in.
