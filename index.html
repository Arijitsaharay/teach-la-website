            A subcommittee of UCLA ACM, ACM Teach LA pairs UCLA undergraduates with schools in Los Angeles to provide free coding classes for students. Our goal is to empower all students with the ability to code and make a difference.

        <p>
            Classes typically run for a quarter and meet once a week. Each class begins with a review before diving into new material. One teacher leads the lesson while others walk around the room to help students. Teachers are expected to attend a weekly meeting to discuss curriculum for the following weekâ€™s lesson. We strongly emphasize pedagogy training and hold seminars to teach how to teach.

            We've developed an open-source online code editor specifically targeted towards students learning how to code. Students can sign up easily, and our service stores and runs their code - which removes issues about using a specific computer, and allows students to access their code anywhere! We currently support Python, HTML, and Processing, and plan on adding more features soon!
